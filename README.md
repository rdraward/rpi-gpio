# rpi-gpio

Learning some of the hardware basics with a breadboard and RPi.
Mostly building off of tutorials, will eventually end up with a game or useful app of some sorts.

Project 1: Mario Party Palm Burn simulator
  Recapture the fun from everyone's favourite original Mario Party game!
  Spin the joystick as fast as you can to light up the LEDs!
